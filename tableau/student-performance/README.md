## Ranked by Strongest Correlation
Values have been rounded to four decimal points with full values below.
| Habit vs. Exam Score | $R^2$ | p-value|Technical Translation|
|:------|:-------|:------|:------|
|Study Hours|0.6650|< 0.0001| The $R^2$ value tells us that the The p-value tells us there is a strong positive relationship between study hours and exam scores. The null hypothesis is sufficiently rejected with a p-value of <0.0001.  |
|Social Media Hours | 0.0302|< 0.0001|There is a strong negative relationship between social media hours and exam scores. The null hypothesis is sufficiently rejected with a p-value of <0.0001.|
|Sleep Hours|0.0140|0.0002| This is statistically signifigant. There is definitely a relationship, but it is not as bulletproof as study hours and social media usage. |
|Exercise Frequency | 0.0134|0.0006| This is statistically signifigant. There is some kind of correlation between exercise and exam scores|
|Netflix Hours  | 0.0284|0.0074|This is statistically signifigant.|
|Attendance|0.0062|0.0134|The correlation relationship beween attendance and exam score is statistically signifigant. Although, it has the weakest correlation of the variables we measured in this study.|
