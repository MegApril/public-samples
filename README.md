# Public Samples
This repository showcases my solutions and analytical approaches to selected exercises from various data analysis and programming challenging books I own. My goal is to demonstrate problem solving, coding and data storytelling skills while respecting original work.

I share:
- My original code, visualizations and explanations
- Snippets of problems or text from books, but never the full text
- Credit for each book, author or source I took the challenge from

I have recieved explicit permission from the authors to display snippets of their work to demonstrate my solutions. I do not share the full text from original work. If you would like to explore the exercises in their original form, I encourage you to purchase the content and support the authors!
